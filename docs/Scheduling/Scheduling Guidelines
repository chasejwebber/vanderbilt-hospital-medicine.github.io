If only attending a conference, will be a protected day request 
If requesting a weekend day, the whole weekend must be requested 
Dates must be entered into QGenda 4 months in advance of a new fiscal quarter.  i.e. protected dates for July-Sept must be requested in QGenda by midnight of June 1.  
New providers will be invited to multiple training and orientation sessions.  You will receive credit/hours for attending:  eStar training, New Clinician Orientation, Hospital Medicine Orientation, New Faculty Orientation, DOM new provider orientation, Advanced practice provider orientation.  Training credit assigned = .1 credit/hr of training.  
Training hours/credit may be offered for specialty service training – procedures, etc.  
If a known extensive leave is necessary during the year (wedding, baby, overseas vacay, etc), please work with Anne to be sure you are on track to meet annual expectations

Scheduling Guidelines
Honor protected day requests
Optimal 4-5 days working in a row
2 day min off after 5 day work stretch
Weekends - We try to schedule no more than 2 weekends in a row.  You may have 3 in a row if you are on Morgan or if you have a heavy weekend protected requests.  
If you work at VA, no Morgan service scheduled
If you work a specialty service (non-Riven) you may work up to 80% on non-Riven services, but are still expected to work Riven.  Generally non-Riven specialty services are limited to one specialty to allow all providers to have opportunities to work non-Riven services.  
48 hrs min off after night stretch
Onboarding days:  Admit, Night 2  = 1; Riven, Obs, Page-Campbell, VICP, Oates = 2; procedure = 3
Holiday Guidelines
5 days around Thanksgiving and Christmas are considered blackout times for requesting protected days.  Thanksgiving block is Wed-Sun, Thanksgiving inclusive.  Christmas block will vary, but will be assigned as the most logical to include Christmas Eve and 26th.  
Submit a request to work either Thanksgiving OR Christmas.  You will be guaranteed to have the other holiday off from clinical schedule.  
If you request to work Thanksgiving, and are scheduled to work Christmas, you are GUARATEED to have Christmas off the following year
By default, you will alternate holidays each year.  If you request to work the same holiday as the previous year, we will try to honor your request, but cannot guarantee.  This may be possible if others are available to fully staff the other holiday. 
Holiday blocks- 5 day protected blocks for Thanksgiving and Christmas.  You will be guaranteed one block off and will work the other block.  We will try to honor your preference of which holiday to work.  If no preference is submitted, the scheduled work holiday will alternate each year.  If too many providers prefer to work the same holiday, you may be scheduled to work your non-preferred holiday.  This will be determined based on the actual number of each holiday worked.  
UM - 
Thanksgiving - 2 full holiday credit.  Work UM 3 full days, and 2 @ 1/2 days
Christmas - 2 full holiday credit.  5 full days.
Other - 1 full holiday credit.  Work Wed of Thx + Mon, Thurs, Fri of Christmas (2024).  In future years, should be Wed of Thx and 3 days of Christmas.

Night Expectations
All faculty hired for 2016-2017 academic year and later, and providers who signed to work nights
100% nocturnists given scheduling priority 
Expected to be called upon to do nights at either VA or VUMC (based on where one does most clinical time) when needed 
(ex. if ≥ 5/8 VA, then you’re expected to do nights at VA)
Will NOT be scheduled for more than you’re contracted averaged throughout the academic year (unless requested) i.e. If you are expected to work 25% nights, you may have 35% in Q1 but then 15% in Q2)
As one increases their tenure with the section, will consider one’s preferences as best we can to remove you from the night pool of providers
Backup
An operative FTE will be used to determine backup days.  This is calculated as Clinical FTE + ½ admin FTE
Riven Backup
Approximately 8 days/operative FTE/yr
No credit assigned for the service, but if you are called in to fill a service, you will receive the service credit you are assigned to work + $150 bonus
Director, Assoc Directors - 12 backup days.  
Assistant directors - 10 backup days.  
Census backup
Preference for new/newer providers and those that do most/all Riven/PC/etc. No leaders should be on this unless voluntarily. 
Scheduled M-F 
.1 credit to be listed in the schedule.  If you are called to handle a census surge, you will earn 1.25 total credit (.1 + 1.15 to work).  

Resident Coverage
Hospitalists will provide coverage for resident services twice/yr:  Holiday Party and End-of-Year Party.  Morgan cross-cover and admit, and VA cross-cover and admit will be staffed with Hospitalists and will receive credit the same as Scoville cross-cover services (1.56)
Those with the most resident exposure will be more likely to be scheduled first

Scheduling Changes
BACKUP:  If backup providers called in to cover a service, provider name remains in backup position and added to the service they are covering.  Credit is assigned to backup service, and credit updated to 0 on service.  The backup credit will prompt the $150 bonus when reconciling at the end of the quarter.  
Census backup:  If census backup provider called in, credit is updated to 1.15.  MHB and pagers will roll for the new team.
-1 SCOVILLE:  If only 4 providers cover 5 Scoville services, additional service hours are split among the working providers, excluding moonlighters.  If 4 working Scoville providers are Hospitalists, all receive 3 additional hours, changing service end time to 10am.  Moonlighters and onboarding APPs are not eligible for this change.  The hours are reconciled at the end of the quarter and will add to total work hours.  Credit is not used for APPs, so not necessary to update.  
PROCEDURE OVERFLOW:  Procedure service overflow is built into Morgan 6 aux.  Other option would be for Morgan to carry side service and provide .1/ea procedure to Admit provider.  Rare occasion will add credit to Morgan 6 aux if provider puts in additional hours of work.
Obs/Admit double cover = 1.5 credits
Swaps for the benefit of the Section/patient that require a change of hours/credit should be kept at the higher shift value - i.e. a Scoville provider moving to cover Night 2 should receive 14 hrs pay instead of the 10 hrs for the N2 service.
Non-proceduralists working the Morgan procedure service will earn .714 Morgan credit, instead of the Morgan procedure credit of 1.0.  Additional procedure credit may be offered to other proceduralists on other services if they can help out during the day.
CEs and Ambulatory providers may earn backup bonus, but pay will be included in their RVU pay, not pay for the shift.
