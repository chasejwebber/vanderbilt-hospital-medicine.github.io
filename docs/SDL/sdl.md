VUMC Operational Policy 10-20.05 Management of Emergent Transfers to VUMC

1. Requests for transfers are coordinated through the Access Center.
2. The Emergency Department (ED) attending or service specific accepting physician coordinates an appropriate transfer with the VUMC Access Center staff and the referring provider/facility. Any denial or delay of accepting an EMC transfer is escalated to the supervisor immediately. NOTE: The ED attending has the authority to accept patients.
3. For patients that require hospital admission, it is the accepting physician or designee's responsibility to admit the patient or secure another admitting physician and primary service. If the patient was accepted by the ED that responsibility lies with the attending physician on the primary service designated by the ED.
4. Patients accepted by the ED are assigned to a primary service by the ED attending. It is the accepting physician or designee's responsibility to admit and treat the patient, or to secure and transfer the patient to another admitting physician and primary service.
